> **⚠️ Status: Intentionally Incomplete**

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Purpose

*   **Modular Base**: The code provides the structural skeleton for a DEX but requires you to build the engine.
*   **Customizable Protocol**: Core logic is abstract, allowing developers to implement their own swap protocols and backend connections as needed.
*   **Privacy-Ready UI**: The interface is designed for a KYC-free experience, waiting for the appropriate backend integration.
*   **Developer Focused**: Created solely for developers who need a head-start on building a custom trading platform.
